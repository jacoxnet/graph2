# Graph2

Rewritten C++ console app that implements a Monte Carlo simulation that calculates the shortest path from the source in an undirected graph generated by the pseudo-random number generator with characteristics defined in constants in the code. The shortest-path algorithm is Dijkstra's.

Output is a printout of the shortest paths

*Written for Homework 2 in Coursera's C++ for C Programmers, Part A*

This effort was rewritten to move functionality relating to the created class into the class file and out of the driver.cpp.

## Files

- *driver.cpp* Calls class methods to create random graph and then calculate paths.
- *matrix.cpp* Implements the Matrix class, which is the data structure that contains the weighted edge list forming the graph. Includes methods that populate the graph randomly and carry out the Dijkstra algorithm.
- *matrix.h* Header file for Matrix class.

## Constants

- *SIZE* Sets the size of the matrix. *E.g.*, SIZE = 20 would implement a 20x20 matrix.
- *DENSITY* The density of edges in the matrix [0, 1]
- *LOWRANGE* and *HIRANGE* Range of weights (distances) to randomly assign edges when creating the graph.
- *SOURCE* number of source node for calculations.
